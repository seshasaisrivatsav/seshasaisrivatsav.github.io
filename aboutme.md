Take 1:
As a senior software engineer at HubSpot, I developed and maintained high-performance CRM services, handling up to 400,000 requests per second. I leveraged technologies such as Java 8, Kafka, Google Guice, Dropwizard, and AWS to build scalable solutions. I was responsible for 24/7 support and quickly resolved alerts to ensure seamless service delivery. I enjoyed making an impact by directly addressing customer issues and collaborating with support agents. Additionally, I documented complex architecture flows that helped new team members and other internal teams.

At Constant Contact, an email marketing company, I worked as a Full Stack Engineer, where I worked on a team that works on parts of the product that gets ~80-90% of traffic. I've had a great opportunity to work on almost everything in the product lifecycle from being part of UX research calls, story refinement, front end, backend, integration testing and mentoring interns and new team members. It's gratifying to build marketing solutions that serve small businesses using technologies like React, Angular, Spring Boot, AWS, HTML, CSS. One of my key accomplishment was to design and deliver marketing calendar, that allowed users to see and create the campaigns through a new calendar view on the go.

Pursing Masters in Computer Science Northeastern University compounded my interest for Software Engineer. I had the pleasure to work for my professor to build Teaching Assistants portal and build the course assignments for the same. I also work on my own projects like Film Nerd - an app to rate and review movies.

As a Cloud Software Engineer Intern at New York Life, I worked on building Insurance as a Service platform using Angular 2/4 using AWS Tech Stack (EC2, S3, Lambda, ECS, API Gateway), JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, DynamoDB, mySQL, database design and modeling.Working in all these varied areas across teams gave me extensive experience in the entire SDLC process of building full stack applications on the cloud.

I worked as Database Analyst at Wells Fargo for 2.5 years where I primarily served Teradata and Aster database applications (using SQL, Shell/Bash Scripting, Autosys and Teradata Tools and Utilities 14.0).During this tenure, I worked with application teams providing them database support with Database design, Query Tuning, Data Migrations, Database Upgrades etc.I also received 22 shared success awards during this period.

While I enjoy a watching a nice movie, I like to travel, film and edit videos. I am an amateur guitarist, budding cook and a certified fitness trainer.I have made a handful short films and post them to YouTube (checkout my social pages linked on this site).


Take 2:

I have a strong passion for computer science, which began when I played the game Dangerous Dave in 1st standard. Impressed by computers and what they could do, I pursued a career in the field, starting with helping my teachers with Microsoft products and making short movies as a high school student. I deepened my knowledge by obtaining a Master's degree in computer science from Northeastern University, where I learned to persistently tackle complex problems and gained confidence as a TA and designed assignments for Web Development course.

I have professional experience working as a Co-op at NewYork Life Insurance, where I built Insurance as a Service using Angular and AWS technologies. Afterwards, I worked as a software engineer II at Constant Contact in Boston for 3.5 years, building marketing software for small businesses and contributing to a team that handled 80-90% of the website traffic. In my recent role as a senior software engineer at HubSpot, in the core CRM team, I was part of building services that power the objects creation and associations between them.

In my free time, I enjoy staying active through working out, running, and playing guitar. I also enjoy video games, cooking and traveling. More details about each role in My Experience section below
